# E-Commerce product search Functionality

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates the use of **Data Structures and Search Algorithms** in Java by simulating a simple **E-Commerce product search** functionality. 

It allows users to:
- Search products by **name** using **linear search**.
- Search products by **category** using a **HashMap** for efficient lookup.
---

### Product Data Structure
### `Product` Class
Each product has:
- `name`: the product name (case-insensitive)
- `category`: the product category (case-insensitive)
- `price`: the product price (double)

---

## Key Functionalities

### `addProduct(Product p)`
- Adds a product to the global list.
- Inserts it into the `HashMap` by category for fast access.

### `searchByName(String name)`
- Performs a **linear search** on the product list.
- Displays products whose names contain the search keyword.

### `searchByCategory(String category)`
- Fetches product set using a **HashMap**.
- Prints all products under the selected category.

| P3      | C2       | 4999    |
| P4      | C2       | 2999    |
| P5      | C3       | 39999   |
